# Excel-to-XML-Converter
Excel to XML Converter is a Python script designed to process Excel files and generate custom template structured XML files for data integration or enterprise digitization scenarios. This project is ideal for scenarios where bulk data from Excel spreadsheets needs to be transformed into an XML format suitable for automated systems or digitization.

### Why This Project Is Useful
- Automates Repetitive Tasks: Saves time and effort by automating the conversion of Excel files to XML in bulk.
- Structured Data Output: Produces XML files with well-organized nodes and attributes tailored for system ingestion.
- Error Handling: Ensures reliability by managing errors in file processing or XML generation.
- Scalable Solution: Processes entire directories of Excel files efficiently, making it suitable for projects of any size.
## How to Get Started
1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/excel-to-xml-converter.git
```    
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Then, install the required Python library:
```
pip install openpyxl
```  
3. Run the Script
The script takes two command-line arguments:

**<input_directory>**: The directory containing Excel files to process.\
**<output_directory>**: The directory where the generated XML files will be saved.
```
python3 script.py <input_directory> <output_directory>
```
### Example:
```
python script.py /path/to/input /path/to/output
```
## 4. Check the Results
The XML files will be saved in the specified output directory, maintaining the subdirectory structure of the input directory.

What the Project Does
Core Functionality
Search and Process: The script scans the input directory and all its subdirectories to find Excel files with the name Full Index.xlsx.
Excel to XML Conversion: For each file found, the script:
Reads data from the Excel file using openpyxl.
Constructs an XML document using xml.etree.ElementTree, including nodes and attributes based on the Excel content.
Saves the XML file to the corresponding subdirectory in the output directory. 
### Output Example 
An XML file generated by the script might look like this:
```XML
<import>  
  <node action="update" type="document">  
    <location>Enterprise:Engineering:Legacy Records:Roads:ProjectA:Record001</location>  
    <category name="Content Server Categories:HC Engineering:Engineering Legacy Records">  
      <attribute name="Project Name">ProjectA</attribute>  
      <attribute name="Permit Number">12345</attribute>  
      <attribute name="Document Type">Blueprint</attribute>  
    </category>  
  </node>  
</import>  
```
